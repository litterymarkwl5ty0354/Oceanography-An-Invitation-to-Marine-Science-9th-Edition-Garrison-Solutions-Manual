  * Developed in partnership with the National Geographic Society, market-leading OCEANOGRAPHY: AN INVITATION TO MARINE SCIENCE, 9e gives you a basic understanding of the scientific questions, complexities, and uncertainties involved in ocean use-as well as the role and importance of the ocean in nurturing and sustaining life on Earth. Seasoned researchers Tom Garrison and Robert Ellis emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of marine science, stressing its links to biology, chemistry, geology, physics, meteorology, astronomy, ecology, history, and economics. The book's focus on the science process includes numerous "How Do We Know?" boxes detailing the science behind how oceanographers know what they know. Coverage of climate change has been updated to reflect the latest findings. In addition, Chapter 14 "Primary Producers" includes expanded coverage of photosynthetic and chemosynthetic producers to help you understand the "big picture" in marine biology.
